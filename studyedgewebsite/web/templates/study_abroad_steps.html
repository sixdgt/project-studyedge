          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Studying abroad is one of the most rewarding decisions you can make for your future. 
            It allows you to experience a new culture, gain global exposure, and access internationally 
            recognized qualifications. For Nepalese students, studying abroad provides access to 
            modern facilities, innovative teaching methods, and a chance to become globally competitive 
            in today’s fast-changing job market.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            Beyond academics, it helps you grow personally — building independence, adaptability, 
            and communication skills that employers around the world value highly.

          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Choosing the right destination and course is crucial for your success. 
            Each country offers unique advantages — Australia and Canada are known for post-study work opportunities, 
            the UK for globally respected degrees, and the USA for research-driven programs.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            At <span class="font-semibold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">StudyEdge</span>, we help you identify
